# react-babel-seed
A really simple application displaying "Hello World". 
It uses a [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The settings are defined in the **gulpfile.js**.

## Dev dependencies
- gulp
- gulp-util
- gulp-compass
- gulp-webserver
- babelify
- watchify
- browserify
- vinyl-source-stream

Once the project is cloned, open a terminal and just write : 

```bash
npm install
```

You should probably check if the versions are correct first, they might be outdated.

## Dependencies
- React

## Run project
When all the dependencies are installed, just do ```gulp watch``` to run the project.
